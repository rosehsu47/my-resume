# Rose Hsu

I have been working as a backend engineer for 5 years, currently contributing to a social trading platform called "SoFinX." My experience spans across e-Commerce systems, CRM, and trading systems, primarily developed using Rust and Golang. Throughout my career, I firmly believe that regular code refactoring is essential for any project, along with maintaining a healthy team culture.
I enjoy learning various things such as foreign languages and new technologies. In my free time, I like watching TV series and anime. I am open to and looking forward to a new challenge and great opportunity in the near future!
